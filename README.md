# The Movie Database

## Tech Stack

This project is built using the following technologies:
- Node.js 
- Express
- React

While this project could have been possible with a simple React frontend this would come with security risks as the API key would have needed to be stored somewhere on the front end. For this reason I have created a simple API using node that receives requests from React and grabs data from the Movie Database API.
